*Redshift and luminosity, what can they hint in our evolving universe?*

## Abstract / Summary of initial research

This research report seeks to analyse the environmental properties of galaxies in the CFDS field in the redshift range: 0.2≤z≤1.2 and its impact on the photometric evolution of these galaxies. Through the application of regression and k-means clustering computer model analysis to the COMBO-17 survey of the CDFS region, we derive a significant clustering surrounding the redshift values z~0.48 and z~1.00, concluding that between these values there is an increase in the galaxy’s luminosity. Furthermore, this report analyses the distribution of galaxies throughout the survey field, observing an increase in spatial density at ~0.48 and z~1.00. Highlighting the work of Vollmer B, 2013 and L. S. Pilyugin et al, 2017, we attribute the observed increase in a galaxy’s spatial density as redshift increase, and therefore the spectral evolution of the galaxy. 

## Research Questions:

1.	Are there distinct clusters of galaxies characterised by redshift and absolute spectral luminosity?
2.	Do these clustering groups support current models surrounding the density of galaxies throughout stages of development?
3.	Can these models (cluster and linear and polynomial regression) classify galaxies into a system describing luminosity in the visual spectrum to redshift and therefore be used to predict properties of newly discovered galaxies?

## Aim and Hypothesis:

Aim: To analyse the relationship between luminosity and redshift in low luminosity galaxies across the visual spectrum and subsequently evaluate the implications of density on the luminosity properties for specifically low luminosity galaxies.
Alternate Hypothesis 1: That distinct galaxy classes will emerge at low luminosities, characterized by their respective redshifts as a representation of the galaxy’s age. (Null Hypothesis 1: That emerging clusters aren’t distinct or that there aren’t any meaningful clusters emerging at low luminosities and these clusters aren’t determined by the density of the galaxies in their surrounding regions.)
Alternate Hypothesis 2: That these clusters are characterised by the spatial density of surrounding galaxies. (Null Hypothesis 2: That these clusters aren’t determined by the spatial density of surrounding galaxies)

## Current Findings

- Decreased relationship between redshift and luminosity at low luminosities
- Distinct (but small) classes of galaxies at low luminsoities (and some at high)
- No significant model from linear regression analysis (r^2 = 0.14)
