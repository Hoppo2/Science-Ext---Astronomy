Redshift and luminosity, what can they hint in our evolving universe?

## Abstract

Abstract on Proposal: Low luminosity galaxies remain at large unanalysed as a result of previous limitations in technology, where the extended visual spectrum was at large undetectable at low luminosities. This report explores the unique relationship between low luminosity galaxies and their redshift values. At low luminosities, a minimum of 2 clusters of galaxies have been observed with redshift values: 1<z<1.2 and 0.2<z<0.5 through brief initial investigation. Through the production of regression and cluster models using sklearn ‘k means cluster’ and ‘linear regression’ algorithms, quantitative relationships can be extracted from the data and further analysed to explore the possible relationship. Subsequently, the models can act to form further predictions on unknown galaxies as well as clarify information on existing clusters provided that a valid relationship is found. 

## Current Findings

- Decreased relationship between redshift and luminosity at low luminosities
- Distinct (but small) classes of galaxies at low luminsoities (and some at high)

## Project Plan

- [ ] Polynomial Regression analysis
